# WGS-for-CRISPR-editors

#	Major modification: UnifiedGenotyper in GATK-3.4-46 was changed to HaplotypeCaller in gatk4(v4.1.6) 
#	It is noted that NO filter steps is performed in this initial variants calling process and thus minimizes the chance of missing real variants 
#	Please download this file and replace old script (globCallUseGATK.pl)
# Make sure the gatk4 (or a laterr version) has been installed correctly
